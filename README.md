# Bachelor Course: Object Oriented Programming 2017-2018
This was a project part of the Object Oriented Programming Bachelor course of academic year 2017-2018 at the KU Leuven

In this assignment, the students (either alone or in groups of two) had to program a simple game that is loosely based on the artillery strategy game *Worms*. The assigment consisted of 3 parts, each of which is explained in the aptly named pdf. 
I did this assignment on my own.

The folder named *ogp1718-gui* has the original code that was provided to us. The folder *ogp1718-project-coenegrachts* contains my project.
